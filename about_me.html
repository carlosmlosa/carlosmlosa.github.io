						<h3>My story</h3>
						<p>I was born in Salamanca (Spain), 1999. My family early settled up in Madrid when I was a baby. Madrid was the place
							where I grew up. I went to a catholic school where I studied for 12 years. During that time I started playing soccer 
							in my school where I rapidly standed out for my passion, dedication, compromise, leadership and team playing attitude. I 
							was the team captain for more than 9 years, I have more than 10 national tournaments participations and I am 2016 senior league subchampion.
							I also combined my studies with the soccer team, english classes and karate (which I practice reaching out brown belt).
							The summers of 2015 and 2016 I spent a month living with a family in New Jersey and Chicago respectively, thank to that
							experiences I mastered my english and I got involved in the american culture.
							I finally, <b>graduated with honors</b> from High School and obtained an <b>excellence scholarship</b> for my grades in the university access exam (EVAU).
						</p>
						<p>I started my university bachelor degree in 2017 in <b>Telecommunication engineering</b> at <a href="https://www.etsit.upm.es/">ETSIT</a> UPM. In 2017 I also started coaching soccer 
							in former categories at the school in which I used to play. I coached from ages 6 to 18 and I participated in 2 national tournaments. 
							This experience help me to develope my communication skills, leadership, team-working, time management and plannification. 
							During that time I also keep playing soccer in the Madrid's federation league, we became 2019-2020 league champions. 
							In 2021 I graduated from my Bachelor degree in Telecommunication engineering with specialization in <b>telematics</b>. Obtaining 
							a score of 10 out of 10 in my final bachelors thesis in which I designed and implemented a NLP tool for a cibersituational
							platform that was being developed in the <a href="https://blogs.upm.es/rsti/">RSTI</a> group. The summer after graduating 
							I participated with my colleges in the design, development and implementation of a software platform for a physical therapy 
							clinic. We collaborate as freelance software developers for building the clinic managment platform.

						</p>
						<p>
							After completing my bachelor degree, in 2021, I decided to continuing my formation pursuing a masters degree in Telecommunication engineering at
							ETSIT UPM. This master program was profesional oriented and it is focused on fulfiling profesional competences as project managment and 
							working in projects with a large amount of people. 
						</p>
						<p>
							For the last year of my formation, I decided to move to Chicago and pursue a more specialized
							master degree in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> at <a href="https://www.iit.edu/">IIT</a>, Illinois Institute of Technology. In this master I learned
							about Deep Learning, NLP, Online Social Networks, Data preparation and analysis, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. During the summer of 
							2023 I will be involved in a research project for developing a Computer Vision tool for "Animal Tracking and behaviour analyisis".
